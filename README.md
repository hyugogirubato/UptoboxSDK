## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è Methode de connexion multiple
- üì¶ Direct use of the service, without restrictions
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy implementation in other programs
- üß© Plug-and-play installation via setup.py
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Forever FOSS!

## Installation

*Note: Requires [Python] 3.7.0 or newer with PIP installed.*

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

You now have the `UptoboxSDK` package installed and a `UptoboxSDK` executable is now available.


### From Source Code

The following steps are instructions on download, preparing, and running the code under a Venv environment.
You can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `pip install .` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.

1. `git clone https://github.com/hyugogirubato/UptoboxSDK`
2. `cd pydvdfab`
3. `python -m venv env`  
4. `source env/bin/activate`   
5. `python setup.py install`

As seen in Step 5, running the `UptoboxSDK` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.
See [Venv's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.

## Usage

The following is a minimal example of using UptoboxSDK in a script. It gets the download link of a
file. There's various stuff not shown in this specific example like:

- Searching for a file
- Uploading a file
- User information
- and much more!

Just take a look around the Client code to see what stuff does. Everything is documented quite well.
There's also various functions in `utils.py` that showcases a lot of features.

```py
from UptoboxSDK.client import Client

# Demo: https://uptobox.com/5w4rff6r17oz
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create client
    client = Client()

    # login
    data = client.login(token="USER_TOKEN")

    # get cached keys
    file_code = "5w4rff6r17oz"
    
    # get file info
    info = client.get_file_info(code=file_code)
    
    # get file download link
    link = client.get_link(code=file_code)
    
    print("I: Subscription: {}".format("PREMIUM" if data["premium"] == 1 else "FREE"))
    print("I: Name: {}".format(info["file_name"]))
    print("I: Size: {}".format(info["file_size"]))
    print("I: Link: {}".format(link))
```
