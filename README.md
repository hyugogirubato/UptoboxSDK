## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è Multiple connection method
- üì¶ Direct use of the service, without restrictions
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy implementation in other programs
- üß© Plug-and-play installation via setup.py
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Forever FOSS!

## Installation

*Note: Requires [Python] 3.7.0 or newer with PIP installed.*

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

You now have the `pybinance` package installed and a `pybinance` executable is now available.


### From Source Code

The following steps are instructions on download, preparing, and running the code under a Venv environment.
You can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `pip install .` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.

1. `git clone https://github.com/hyugogirubato/pybinance`
2. `cd pybinance`
3. `python -m venv env`  
4. `source env/bin/activate`   
5. `python setup.py install`

As seen in Step 5, running the `pybinance` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.
See [Venv's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.

## Usage

The following is a minimal example of using pybinance in a script. He obtains the access token
of a registered device There's various stuff not shown in this specific example like:

- ...
- and much more!

Just take a look around the Client code to see what stuff does. Everything is documented quite well.
There's also various functions in `utils.py` that showcases a lot of features.

```py
from pybinance import Client

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = Client()
    client.immed_register(device_id="4a48e4adc872f0755da18b8d1294a878")
```
